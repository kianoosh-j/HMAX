-I cleaned and improved the function in file_processing.cpp : read_picture_from_file which was named Pixel before

-I defined a class named Patch

-I started customizing the code to match the new implemented class, Patch
	-In C1.cpp & C1.h
		- extract_random_patches
		- extract_arandom_patch 
	-In file_processing.cpp & file_processing.h
		-write_patches_information_to_file
	-In file myC2.cpp
		-run_c2_for_all_pictures
		-C2_function
		-struct input_dat
